  To find other possible module matches execute:

      $ module -r spider '.*Python.*'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For detailed information about a specific "Python" package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
  Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules.
  For example:

     $ module spider Python/3.12.3-GCCcore-13.3.0
