  To find other possible module matches execute:

      $ module -r spider '.*Python.*'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For detailed information about a specific "Python" package (including how to load the modules) use the module's full name.
  Note that names that have a trailing (E) are extensions provided by other modules.
  For example:

     $ module spider Python/3.12.3-GCCcore-13.3.0

--- Conclusões Finais ---
O modelo obteve uma acurácia geral de 72.37%.
A matriz de confusão e o relatório de classificação indicam que há confusões entre
determinadas classes, o que sugere a necessidade de aprimoramentos na extração de features
ou na arquitetura do modelo.
Recomenda-se, para trabalhos futuros, salvar o scaler utilizado no treinamento para garantir
que o pré-processamento na inferência seja idêntico e, assim, evitar discrepâncias que possam
afetar a performance.
Inference runtime: 61 seconds
Pipeline total runtime: 320 seconds
